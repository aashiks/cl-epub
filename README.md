# cl-epub

An epub library for common lisp.

## About
cl-epub is a library for working with epub books in common lisp. The goal is to
abstract away the complexities of epub files and enable the user to create an
epub book by just entering the paragraphs and titles for the sections/chapters.

The following document describe how to use cl-epub: [How to use the library to
create an epub book](https://github.com/fabstr/cl-epub/blob/master/howto.md)

Since epub books are based on xhmtl an html generation library is used
extensivly and is also available for the user (for example.to create tables in a
lispy way). [How to use the html generation
library](https://github.com/fabstr/cl-epub/blob/master/html-generation.md)
